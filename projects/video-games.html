            A sedentary lifestyle can take its toll in one’s health, so while everyone was locked down in 2020, some people in Japan turned to an unlikely ally to beat inactivity amid pandemic lockdowns: a video game.
            </div>
          <div class="block">
            Welcome to the world of Ring Fit Adventure, where players do not complete journeys pressing joysticks while sitting idly in the living room. Instead, the game asks you to hold into the “Ring Con”, a round accessory shaped as a Pilates ring, while wearing a leg strap, both of which are designed for the game characters to move alongside you.
          </div>
          <div class="block">
            The game, developed by Nintendo for its Switch console in late 2019, shot up to popularity among Japanese citizens forced in lockdown by the spread of coronavirus in 2020. That year, unit sales rose over three-fold to 1.6 million from just over 490,000 a year ago as people tried to sweat it up while gyms were closed, and parks were a no-go for joggers.

          <div class="block">
            According to Famitsu, a magazine that releases an annual ranking of video games in Japan, Ring Fit Adventure jumped to second place in 2020 from tenth place the previous year in terms of number of console units sold. Its rise to the top that year was beaten only by a newly released game from the popular Animal Crossing series that sold over 6.3 million copies.

            Sales of Ring Fit Adventure in Japan also remained elevated— at 905,000 units— last year despite some pandemic restrictions already getting eased, a signal that not all were comfortable going out while the coronavirus was very much out there. Cases <a href="https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/2019-ncov-e.html">peaked anew</a> in Japan in early February as the infectious Omicron variant spread.

            <strong>Legacy games</strong>
          </div>
          <div class="block">
            Ring Fit Adventure was not your usual frontrunner in a list typically dominated by legacy video games. In 2021, 12 Super Mario Bros. games from Nintendo entered the Top 100 selling 3.6 million units in Japan despite registering a 12% dip year-on-year. Another Nintendo classic, Pokemon, had three games in the same list. 
          </div>
          <div class="block">
            More broadly, Nintendo's Super Mario and Pokemon have performed better than other franchise games of other game developers during the past two years. For instance, Capcom's Resident Evil which is played in PlayStation, suffered a decline in unit sales from about 400,000 in 2019 to 280,000 in 2021.

           <div class="block">
             Meanwhile, Square Enix's Final Fantasy, which has games in both Switch and PlayStation, was not salvaged by PS5's launch in 2020 with a Final Fantasy VII remake, data showed. Unit sales plummeted about 97% to just 34,000 units sold last year. This was partly because Final Fantasy released fewer new games in 2021 than in 2020.

            Japanese consumers are known as notoriously hesitant spenders on anything from food to cars, but video games are something they binge on and rooted in their culture. Popular games often started as anime, a Japanese colloquial term used to describe animated TV and film originating from the country. 
            </div>
            <div class="block">
            Beyond that, video games are also crucial dollar earners for Japan which exports their games, making it a <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/the-gamers-powering-japans-22-1-billion-games-market-consumer-motivations-behavior-data/">$22-billion industry</a>. Clearly, nothing can stop the Japanese from playing, not even the coronavirus.
