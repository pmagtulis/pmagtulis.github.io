    <div class="block">
      When the pandemic shut down New York City's streets in 2020, Sajjad Khan sold two of his cars and spent some of
      the proceeds to fund a home renovation— not to repaint their walls or build his children a new bedroom, but to
      give his pigeons reliable shelter.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      The renovation is on the roof deck of his three-story home in Flatbush, Brooklyn: two new bird coops made of
      concrete, each one of them roughly the size of a small bathroom.
      The new shelters and a steel cage atop one of them replaced smaller wood pens for his 60 pigeons. Khan said he
      spent thousands of dollars for them, but did not mind doing so for what he considers family.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      Khan is part of a small number of Pakistani immigrants who take care of pigeons in the city despite the hefty
      cost. Back in Pakistan, it is a family tradition passed on from fathers to sons that does not cost much. But in
      one of the world's most expensive cities, pigeon tending does not come cheap.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      Apart from spending on the new lofts and stairs leading to them, Khan said he also buys his pigeons feeders or
      food for birds, and vitamins imported from Belgium monthly. At one point, he was also shelling out $100 a week to
      hire someone to clean the coops every day, but the worker did not meet Khan's standards.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      “He did not clean well,” Khan, 40, said. “The pigeons don't eat when the coop is not cleaned well.”
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      Known as "kabootarbazi" in Urdu language, pigeon tending is prominent in South Asia including Pakistan. <a
        href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/pjhs.3.1.04#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">Scholars
        believe</a> the tradition gained traction in mid-1500s when Indian Emperor Muhammad Akbar housed over 20,000
      pigeons and strategically used them to impress foreign visitors, exact concessions and ultimately expand the
      Mughal Empire toward India's neighboring countries.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      Nowadays, pigeon tending carries a more positive significance for Pakistanis. It reflects commitment to family, a
      vow to cherish and nurture them, said Manan Ahmed, a history professor who specializes in South Asia at Columbia
      University.
      The tradition attracts mostly men, particularly those with enough means to sustain it, part of Muslim communities'
      divided gender roles.

    <br>
    <div class="block">
      The work demanded by petting pigeons however is no joke. Apart from feeding them and cleaning their shelters,
      pigeon raisers said this type of bird also needs heat to survive New York's freezing winter. Khan ensured this for
      his flock by installing heaters in their lofts.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      He also personally attends to them: before working at night as an Uber driver, he cleans the loft and feed his
      pigeons at around 4 p.m.
      After a 12-hour night shift, he cleans again just before he hits the sack.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      Khan's dedication to his pigeons is rewarded with loyalty. They easily recognize his voice and respond to him as a
      flock.
      On a recent Monday afternoon, pigeons quietly sitting in the steel cage almost simultaneously swooped down to
      their coop as he called them for dinner. He says they won't eat if anyone else tries to feed them.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      "Their meal schedule is 4-5 p.m. I don't go anywhere at the time. If I am somewhere, I have to go back here to
      feed them. Otherwise, they won't eat," he said.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      <strong>Cost of tradition</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      While pigeon tending is common back in Pakistan, only a few Pakistanis are able to continue in New York, mostly
      because the cost of living in Pakistan is far lower than in New York City, Columbia's Ahmed said.
      Here, nearly one in five Pakistanis were living below the poverty line even before the pandemic struck.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      These stark differences in living costs are most obvious in a person's house.
      Ahmed said that in Pakistan, pigeon tenders usually have three to four-story homes with rooftops, which is ideal
      for pigeons because owners typically fly them around.
      But few people in New York can afford to have their rooftops.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      Such is the case for Ahmed Ali, an Islamabad native, who had 80 pigeons back home but gave them to friends before
      leaving for New York in 2005.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      Ali, currently unemployed, used to work several jobs in New York, including being a taxi driver, a Deicer safety
      clearance officer at the John F. Kennedy International Airport, and a religious studies teacher.
      An imam who gives free spiritual advice, he said pigeon tending itself does not hold any religious significance
      for Pakistanis, but a part of their culture that grew because of the pigeon's heavy presence in the country.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      "I don't see myself being ready to even think about pets in New York,” said Ali. “It's just not practical. If I
      decided to get a pigeon now, that would eat my time so much that I would just have to be tending to my pigeons and
      I wouldn't do anything else."
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      Until recently, <a
        href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn-pakistani-nabes-raising-pigeons-taste-life-back-old-country-article-1.145597"
        target="_blank">Mohammad Asif</a>, 60, could easily juggle work and tending to his pigeons.
      Asif runs a construction business in Midwood, and said he typically caps his day atop his home and flying some of
      his birds. Originally from Lahore, he personally asked his brother to send him 12 pairs of their pigeons at home
      when he moved to the city in 1986, unable to find what he called a "Pakistani pigeon."
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      That kind of pigeon, Khan and Asif said, is less about where it comes from, but rather how it looks like,
      something only obvious to pigeon raisers. For instance, a Pakistani pigeon, they said, would tend to stand tall,
      rather than slouch, have a firmer belly than the average pigeon, and more importantly, "good" eyes.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <img src="https://pmagtulis.github.io/assets/colored-pigeon.jpg" alt="racing pigeon feathers New York">
    <figcaption><em><small>Khan colors some the feathers of his racing pigeons, which he said allows him to easily
          identify them even while on air. Birds also bear marks from the race where they participated in.</em> Prinz
      Magtulis</small></figcaption>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="container column is-half-desktop is-full-mobile is-full-tablet">
    <div class="block">
      Asif bred on his pigeons, growing his flock over six times since then. Nowadays however, Asif, Khan's friend,
      admitted barely having time, he had to ask his 19-year-old son Hassan to do the pigeon chores often.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      When Asif visited and got stuck for 11 months in Pakistan because of pandemic travel restrictions, Hassan stepped
      on to his shoes, ran his father's coops and gave the birds all their needed care.
      “He would call me everyday to ask me what to do. When I came back, there was no problem; my birds are all
      healthy," said Asif, who arrived back in the US last week of September.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      So far, that was the closest Asif could get to passing on a family heritage. Hassan did not get his fascination to
      pigeons, but Asif said he is responsible enough to ensure the birds stay healthy especially when he is not around,
      and that is enough for him. "He's not into the hobby, but he helps me all the time," Asif said.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      <strong>A private, public affair</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      This privacy afforded to pigeons is only often sidestepped in gatherings when pigeon races are held as a "sport"
      and owners invest on them heavily, Ahmed said.
      Even in those instances though, the relationship between pigeon owners and their pets is unmistakable: Khan, for
      instance, has made an anklet for one of his pigeons because, he said, "she is my favorite."
      That is a racing pigeon which has won him several competitions.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      Pointing to another pigeon— one with pink-colored feathers— Khan said, "This one has never lost a race and it's
      been with me for the past 13 years." He colors some strands of these pigeons to more easily identify them while
      they are in the air.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      More than winning races though, Khan believes his pigeons are like his family, which he should treat well and
      fondly.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      Asif agrees with him. "They make me really happy," he said. <strong><em>Prinz Magtulis</em></strong>
