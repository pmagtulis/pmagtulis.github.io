                <em>Note: This story was originally written on May 2, while the election campaign period was still ongoing.</em>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                Kristine Joy Patag stood beside other reporters, watching former senator Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos deliver his speech at his hometown in Ilocos Norte last February. 
                Journalists were preparing for an ambush interview afterwards. But they're not sure if they were getting one.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                If surveys are to be believed, Marcos, 64, is set to become the country's next president by June 30. 
                The latest poll barely a week before the May 9 elections put him at a comfortable 30-point lead against his nearest rival, and if elected, would be the first Philippine president to garner majority support since the restoration of democracy in 1986.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                Filipino journalists are dreading that moment. Already, reporters like Patag who cover the Marcos beat believe they are seeing a prelude to how the Marcos presidency would treat the media: no interviews, briefings or debates, and limited public interactions to press statements very well massaged to keep his critics at bay. 
                For Marcos, that means evading questions and criticisms from his eager opponents. For Filipinos, there is less chance of making their government accountable.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                "They're hostile. They will make it hard for you to cover," said Lian Nami Buan, a reporter who covers the Marcos campaign for Rappler, a local news site.

            <br>
            <div class="block">
                But the real danger of a Marcos presidency, journalists said, happens not on the campaign trail, but inside the newsroom. 
                There, editors are often forced to tone down reference to the Marcoses' <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/12/philippines-marcos-memory-election/" target="_blank">dark past</a> at the behest of their corporate owners seeking favor from the election frontrunner. At the extreme, entire stories are killed, while those able to get past the gatekeepers are taken down.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                Marcos's influence in the newsroom goes deep. At CNN Philippines, for instance, reporters and editors had to protest a <a href="https://verafiles.org/articles/cnn-philippines-struggles-use-dictator-vs-strongman" target="_blank">memo</a> from the management released last October that asked them to avoid using the word “dictator” in their stories when describing Marcos' father, whose human rights atrocities and corruption are well documented in history books.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                Journalists pushed back, and the memo was leaked to the media, prompting the management to walk back the order. But every now and then, the Marcoses make their presence felt.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                "We still use it (“dictator”) now. Sometimes it sees print, sometimes it doesn't," CNN correspondent Rex Remitio, who covers the presidential campaign for the first time, said.

            <div class="block">
                <strong>The Duterte connection</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                For the Philippines, Southeast Asia's oldest democracy, the fight against disinformation only heats up during election season. 
                The country, along with other countries like India and France also holding elections this year, is a hotbed of falsehoods and fake news meant to deceive voters by tarnishing and propping up candidates' image.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                Marcos is the biggest beneficiary of misinformation in the Philippines, a <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1572763/marcos-jr-winning-ph-poll-misinformation-drive-analysis" target="_blank">recent study</a> has found, helping him rebrand his family's reputation from one despised over three decades ago to now being revered by millions of Filipinos. 
                The entire disinformation network was not established overnight, but rather a consistent effort that started way back in 2010, the Washington Post had learned.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                Then came Rodrigo Duterte, the outgoing president. In 2016, Duterte weaponized disinformation to win the presidency with over 16 million votes.<sup>**</sup>
                He then spent his six years in office discrediting the media, attacking free speech, and running after journalists like Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa who refuse to toe the government's line.
            </div>
            <figure class="image is-128x128-centered">
                <img src="https://pmagtulis.github.io/charts/bbm-sara.png" alt="Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte attending one of their campaign rallies.">
                <figcaption><em><small>Marcos ran in tandem with Sara Duterte, President Rodrigo Duterte's daughter, who also won the vice presidency.</em>Source: The Manila Times</small></figcaption>
               </figure>
            <br>
            <div class="block">
                At the same time, Duterte helped the Marcoses rehabilitate their family name— from allowing their dictator to be buried at the Hero's Cemetery, to his symbolic absence in annual celebrations of the EDSA People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos. 
                That celebration is a national holiday in the Philippines every February 25. 
                Duterte's daughter, Sara, is also running in tandem with Marcos for vice president.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                "Duterte appealed to the strongman fantasies of the electorate and what Marcos represents is a continuation of that, couched in nostalgia of his father's rule," said Jonathan Ong, an associate professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst, who has done research about disinformation.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                The effect of whitewashing is palpable in the campaign trail. Buan would see people clad in red—a color long associated with the Marcoses—cheering and tearing up upon seeing the younger Marcos deliver his scripted speech. Some even sing along to the tune of "Bagong Lipunan (New Nation)," a song closely associated with human rights atrocities of the Marcos dictatorship.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                Social media played a key role in amplifying disinformation. During the 2016 elections, Facebook experimented with free access in the Philippines, where citizens are <a href="https://philstarlife.com/geeky/844848-sortlist-social-media-filipinos-study" target="_blank">most exposed</a> to social media than the rest of the world. 
                Their unregulated nature, coupled with their wide reach, have enabled election campaigns to get their message straight to the voters or through social media influencers.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                That, in turn, has emboldened politicians to attack journalists without fear of losing their appeal to their audience constantly fed with disinformation on TikTok or Facebook.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                At the Marcos campaign, for instance, Buan said vloggers and influencers get more priority access to sorties than reporters. In one sortie at Manila last April 23, Buan <a href="https://twitter.com/lianbuan/status/1517798286752911363" target="_blank">tweeted</a> that journalists were pushed to an area "with a fence" far from the stage to avoid contact with Marcos.
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                "It's easy to notice from afar the vloggers because you would see their phone cameras all directed toward the stage," Patag said. "One time, we were having difficulty tweeting because there were signal jammers in the campaign. 
                Yet we see tweets from vloggers. It turned out they were granted access to Wi-Fi."
